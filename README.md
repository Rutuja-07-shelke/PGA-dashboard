## 📘 Project Overview

This is my Power BI dashboard project focused on analyzing plant growth across also the role of sunlight, temperature, fertilizer, and watering in plant growth

I originally developed it as part of a virtual internship with TheSmartBridge, but I’ve since rebuilt it from scratch to reflect what I’d deliver in a real-world data analytics role — complete with optimized visuals, DAX-driven KPIs, region-based insights .

Through this dashboard, I aim to answer:

•	Key conditions affecting plant growth
•	The role of sunlight, temperature, fertilizer, and watering
•	Comparative performance by categories

## 💡 Key Highlights
- 🔢 **Growth Success KPI**: it immediately shows overall performance.
- 🎯 **Top Filters Aligned**: Soil Type, Water Frequency, and Fertilizer Type slicers .
- 📈 **scatter plot**: Sunlight vs Temperature with Growth Outcome
- 🍩 **Donut Chart**: Average Environmental Conditions
- 🧠 **Bar Chart**: Growth_Milestone by Fertilizer_Type
- 🧱 **treemap**: Average Growth milestone with soil and fertilizer type
